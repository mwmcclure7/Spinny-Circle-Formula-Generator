To generate these orbiting circles, simply run the program and type 0 for a base circle (this circle will not be animated). Then, go to [desmos.com/calculator](url), and paste the equation into the graphing calculator. Then, create variables for r, m, s, and t.

"r" is the radius of the base circle.

"m" is the size modifier for each layer of circles.

"s" is the speed modifier for each layer of circles.

"t" is a time variable. Next to where you created the variable, there is an arrow icon. Click on that icon, and choose the option that plays indefinitely.

Next generate the orbiting circles. Run the program, and type the number of circles that are currently on the graph. Then, copy and paste these equations into the graphing calculator (you may need to reformat some of the exponents and square roots).

Finally, press play next to the "t" variable, and observe as the circles orbit each other. Notice how changing the other variables affects the rotation or size of the circles.
